# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### step 1
Import the required libraries. 
### step 2 
Upload and read the dataset.
### step3 
Check for any null values using the isnull() function.
### step 4
From sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier and use criterion as entropy
### step 5
Find the accuracy of the model and predict the required values by importing the required module from sklearn.

## Program:
